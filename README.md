# Recommender-System
The goal here is to explore different types of recommendation systems algorithms. Here we deploy the following methods to recommend news based on a specific news article from the dataset itself.
1. Matrix Factorization(SVD Decomposition)
2. Content Based Filtering(Pearson Correlation Coefficient)
3. Nearest Neighbors ALgorithm
4. Clustering Algorithms

The dataset is a simple one, containing different articles as rows and columns being details about the article, such as
1. Text
2. Title
3. Date
4. keywords
5. summary
6. title_summary
